    // Builder pattern in Java
    // "this" always points to current/calling object

    // just like one bye one the building is created.

    // we can not use the java program in intellij for Rest Assured
    // because we need to use the tools like,
    // Allure report, testNG, POI(DDT),AssertJ,cucumber BDD etc..
    // Maintain lib, life cycle, install lib, updation, clean older code, creating jars, running program
    // so we need 0 build automation tool - Java
